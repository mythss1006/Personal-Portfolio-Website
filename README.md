## Project Description
The Personal Portfolio Website is a professional and interactive web project that highlights my skills, projects, education, and achievements in a single platform. It is designed to provide recruiters, clients, or collaborators with a comprehensive view of my abilities, experience, and personal brand.

This website is fully responsive and built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a seamless experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. It emphasizes clean design, smooth navigation, and visually appealing layouts that make information easily accessible.

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate my web development skills, attention to detail, and ability to design user-friendly interfaces. It also serves as a professional portfolio that can be shared via GitHub or hosted online to leave a lasting impression on potential employers or clients.
